1,Absolutely Useless Travel Insurance – Total Waste of Money! ,"I purchased travel insurance expecting it to actually help in case of an issue, but my experience proved otherwise. My baggage was delayed, and I had to spend $227 on necessary personal items while waiting for it. When I filed a claim, I was asked to submit a ridiculous amount of documentation—receipts, proof of delay, forms, and more—only to receive an insulting reimbursement of $3!Yes, three dollars after all that effort. The time I wasted preparing and submitting the claim was worth far more than that. What’s the point of buying insurance if it doesn’t actually cover real expenses? They take your money upfront but make the claims process so frustrating and pointless that you might as well not even bother.I will never buy travel insurance from this company again, and I strongly warn others to stay away.

1,Doesn't cover missed connection because of missing luggage through customs checkpoint.,"I have purchased Travel Insurance with TravelInsured for many years and travel 3 to 5 times a year, but going forward, I will look elsewhere for coverage.I was on a flight home that had two stopovers.  Apparently my baggage was not transferred between flight #1 and #2.   When I arrived internationally at LAX, I was delayed waiting for my luggage to appear so that I could take it through customs.  My luggage was not there, and as a result I missed my connecting flight and was booked on another flight about 20 hrs later.   After a 15 hour flight from Singapore, I called the customer service and was told I had a $200 limit, so I booked a hotel room.  Oh well, because I missed my connection not because of a flight delay, my claim was denied.   Since my luggage was found 6 hrs later, and then put on my same rebooked flight, there was no delay.

1,Buyer Beware - Travel Insured Intl' ,"Travel Insured International is a great company with a variety of plans and they are eager to assist you....that is, until you file a claim. I had to cancel my trip with my neighbors to the UK and Ireland last August because my husband was hospitalized with heart failure and was in the ICU the week before we were to depart. He remained in the hospital until September 30 (my trip dates were Aug 29-Sept 16). I filed a claim on 9/17/24. For four months, Travel Insured Internation repeatedly asked for ""additional documentation"" to include medical records, doctors' letters, proof of a medical event, etc. I ended sending in 22 documents of his medical situation, along with documentation of all money lost (due to non-refundable down payments for AirBnBs). I did not claim my air fare since United issued me a credit for 12 months. Travel Insured International finally did pay after four months, but not the full amount I had requested. They shorted me over $600 on the deposits for the AirBnBs. Because I was traveling with my neighbors (a married couple), we had split the cost of the AirBnBs in half (2 separate households). Instead of reimbursing me for my half of the deposit, Travel Insured International paid me 1/3 since there were ""2 other people on the reservation"". I documented my out-of-pocket expenses with Venmo receipts but apparently the loophole was that there were 3 people on the reservation. So TII found a way of mathing to minimize their reimbursement to me. My only recourse now is to complain with my state's Department of Commerce & Insurance. This has been a terrible experience, especially since my cancellation was due to my husband's legitimate medical emergency (thankfully he is much better now). If you decide to purchase travel insurance and use this company, be prepared to be strung out for months sending in ""additional documentation"" regarding your claim and to leave quite a bit of money owed you on the table.

1,"DON""T EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY","DO NOT - DO NOT – DO NOT use this company for any type of Travel Insurance -YOU’LL BE SORRY YOU DID!In my opinion, it is absolutely, the worst staffed company in the USA, including the President and CEO who have absolutely no customer care skills, no compassion, ridiculous rules, and horrific and torturous claim filing procedures. The bottom line, they will do anything to deny your claim.After getting nowhere with their claims representative, I asked to speak with a supervisor. IT TOOK 3 DAYS FOR A SUPERVISOR TO RESPOND and he give me the same excuses why the company could not pay the claim.I then wrote the CEO and the President of the company and here is an exact quote from the response I received from the President’s Office: “I wanted to review where we are now with your claim.  I understand that Justin from claims reached out and you two had a conversation regarding our need for the supporting documents we have requested. You are right that it would seem insensitive for us to question your claim request.  We looked into the timeline of the claim and the trip was cancelled prior to your wife expiring.  Hence, it is a claim for trip cancellation based on sickness, not death.” “We understand why you feel we are insensitive as we have a death certificate. However, because of the trip cancellation prior to your wife’s death, we need to review for payment based on sickness.  I hope you understand. “My wife took out their insurance in March or April for a trip to Italy in September with her brother, sisters, nieces and nephews – a trip of a lifetime that she was looking forward to. On May 10th, 2024, she was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer and died on May 31st, 2024.In May she filed a claim with the company that she wasn’t feeling well. In the beginning they sent a claim form for the charges that were being claimed. When she passed away just a few weeks later THAT’S WHEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. As her surviving spouse I simply forwarded the DEATH CERTIFICATE, since we took out the optional coverage, to cancel for any reason. IT SEEMS THE DEATH CERTIFICATE IS UNACCEPTABLE TO THEM TO PROCESS THE CLAIM – IT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR “ANY” REASON.Their response was “She started the claim as “SICK” and must be “PROCESSED” as sick.” That’s when I was tortured by them making me revisit all the doctors and clinics to get the ridiculous claim forms filled out by the doctors. Bringing back the devasting memories of my poor sick wife, suffering in pain, at all these locations. The doctor’s offices were MORTIFIED that this company refused to accept a DEATH CERTIFICATE, whereas in the medical and legal professions, a death certificate is considered as absolute proof. COMPLETELY INSANE and INHUMANE.THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 6 MONTHS AND NO PAYMENT FOR THE CLAIM HAS BEEN SENT TO ME. JUST MORE FORMS AND MORE EXCUSES.

Travel Insured International along with Robin assist and the medical coordination that occurred genuinely saved my mother’s life-I believe.

I will be forever grateful to your company and to all the helped my family in a difficult time. It made the medical journey so much easier than I ever thought it could be. They coordinated the evacuation flight and admission into a trauma hospital in Florida within 20 hours of her injury. The flight crew took amazing care of my mother and delivered us safely to the United States.  I have been a nurse for 28 years and know the difficulties involved in coordinating a transfer of this caliber and your team did it flawlessly. Thank you all for your help. We will be life long customers and am so grateful to see my mother recovering from her injuries and already talking about where she would like to travel next. ,2024-09-06,Medical emergency .

3,"Charleston, Savannah Five Day Tour","Tour leader:  All well for Janet—energetic, well organized, friendly, interacted with everyone in the group, punctual, made sure everyone knew the itinerary and time frame, patient when the flight was late and check-in staff was slow at Bradley, scrambled out of the bus and searched for anyone missing the return time.  No complaints.Tour:  Overall, not so good. Complaints:  This was not a five-day tour but a three day tour as two whole days were travel days.  Why not leave Bradley early a.m. for a little time in Charleston?  Then, local cultural tours ate up valuable time sacrificing time to visit Charleston—walk around, visit shops, etc.  I felt I never experienced Charleston other than the local tour.  Either reserve an all-afternoon excursion for longer tours or make make them optional for participants who would rather explore Charleston. Really!  All afternoon for a tea farm and mostly travel time?  And wine tasting at 10:00 a.m.?  Could have skipped that entirely!  More of a balance between group activities and solo activities.  And every day we spent getting somewhere was a lost day!Next, there was absolutely no consideration for those participants of age or with knee problems and other ailments even though your tourist pool was, I believe, entirely from senior centers.  While no one was handicapped, three or four used canes, one a leg brace, and I struggled with an injured knee. Several restaurants were in historic districts where no accommodations were available for easy and safe access.  In one particular restaurant, The Smoke House, our party was assigned to seating up a flight and a half of stairs!  Several folks had to be helped, and I had to crawl on my hands and knees! I had asked the manager for handicap accessibility, and he responded that no handicapped accommodations are allowed in the historic distract, but I could sit downstairs and have someone bring me a plate of food!      Additionally, none of the bathrooms hand grab bars, a safety feature for anyone.  At the Oyster House, trying to stand—no grab bar or any support—I fell and the manager was called by friends. Next, in Savannah we all agreed a better choice could have been made for a tour other than the Juliette Low Birthplace or just give free time. Scary watching folks w/canes struggling on the stairs.  Overall consensus—boring.One more tiny complaint….restaurants should be instructed to take drink orders before dinner and deliver them before dinner so we have time for a pre dinner cocktail.  At Paula Deen’s, we all had to ask for drink orders to be taken and never received the drinks until after dinner!  At the Smoke House and Crab Shack, they know how to do it right.  Drink orders taken and delivered right away.  Then dinner orders were taken. Side note:  I would have loved a meal at The Pirate’s House. By the way, my complaints are making me sound like an old, feeble woman….hardly the case.Praise:  Very convenient to have ALL fees and gratuities   included in the tour cost.  We were never charged any extra fees or add-ones.All the local guides were excellent—knowledgeable, interesting, vivacious, helpful with lunch recommendations.

I had asked the manager for handicap accessibility, and he responded that no handicapped accommodations are allowed in the historic distract, but I could sit downstairs and have someone bring me a plate of food!      Additionally, none of the bathrooms hand grab bars, a safety feature for anyone.  At the Oyster House, trying to stand—no grab bar or any support—I fell and the manager was called by friends. Next, in Savannah we all agreed a better choice could have been made for a tour other than the Juliette Low Birthplace or just give free time. Scary watching folks w/canes struggling on the stairs.  Overall consensus—boring.One more tiny complaint….restaurants should be instructed to take drink orders before dinner and deliver them before dinner so we have time for a pre dinner cocktail.  At Paula Deen’s, we all had to ask for drink orders to be taken and never received the drinks until after dinner!  At the Smoke House and Crab Shack, they know how to do it right.  Drink orders taken and delivered right away.  Then dinner orders were taken. Side note:  I would have loved a meal at The Pirate’s House. By the way, my complaints are making me sound like an old, feeble woman….hardly the case.Praise:  Very convenient to have ALL fees and gratuities   included in the tour cost.  We were never charged any extra fees or add-ones.All the local guides were excellent—knowledgeable, interesting, vivacious, helpful with lunch recommendations.  Good choices!Night cruises were good choices as well as the dolphin watch.  Another night adventure in Savannah for those who do not wish to be on the water: ghost tour.",NEGATIVE

The claims rep, Wyatt, that I initially spoke with, said that because I didn’t cancel at the date of the first treatment was the reason of their refusal to refund the full price. So I asked if I did cancel on the date of my treatment I would get a full refund? Her response was, “I don’t answer theoretical questions.” How crazy making is that? Realistically, if we were talking about a hundred bucks I could let it go. We’re talking about the loss of over two-thousand dollars.The other one star reviews of this company are accurate in their descriptions of the processes in filing a claim, and the issues and tactics that this company employs.I’m also baffled at the five star reviews that state they bought a policy but never had to file a claim.

As a frequent traveler, I have always believed in the importance of having reliable travel insurance to protect myself during my trips. Unfortunately, my recent experience with Travel Insured Insurance has left me extremely dissatisfied.  Firstly, the process of purchasing the insurance was not as straightforward as I had expected. The website was confusing and difficult to navigate, making it hard to find the information I needed. Additionally, the lack of transparency regarding the coverage and limitations of the policy left me feeling uncertain about what I was actually signing up for.  Furthermore, when I needed to file a claim due to a medical emergency during my trip, I encountered numerous difficulties. The claims process was overly complicated, with excessive paperwork and documentation required. It felt as though Travel Insured Insurance was actively trying to discourage customers from making claims.  To make matters worse, the customer service support I received throughout this ordeal was subpar. The representatives I spoke to were unhelpful and lacked the knowledge necessary to assist me effectively. I was left feeling frustrated and abandoned during a time when I needed support the most.

1,Awful Experience,"We spent almost $500 for insurance through Travel Insured International for our trip to Egypt. We chose this company because terrorism was covered. After the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7, there was a terrorist incident on October 14 in Alexandria, Egypt where 2 tourists and their guide were murdered while touring ancient sites. Because our entire 14 day trip was in Egypt, we decided because of the October 14 incident that it was not safe to travel there. I submitted a claim on October 14, 2023 siting terrorism as the reason. After submitting document after document and after numerous phone calls, the claim was denied on January 8, 2024.

We spent almost $500 for insurance through Travel Insured International for our trip to Egypt. We chose this company because terrorism was covered. After the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7, there was a terrorist incident on October 14 in Alexandria, Egypt where 2 tourists and their guide were murdered while touring ancient sites. Because our entire 14 day trip was in Egypt, we decided because of the October 14 incident that it was not safe to travel there. I submitted a claim on October 14, 2023 siting terrorism as the reason. After submitting document after document and after numerous phone calls, the claim was denied on January 8, 2024.

They said they would not refund, but that they would hold my payment available for a future trip. Just last month, July 2023, we planned and booked a trip to Norway, for next Feb 2024. At this time they said they would not honor the balance toward insurance because all travel had to take place before the end of 2023. So even though we booked during 2023, just because the trip was less than 2 months after the end of the year, they refused to honor the prior commitment.
